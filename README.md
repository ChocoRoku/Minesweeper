# Minesweeper project

# Backstory
I started this project when I remembered this game existed. As a kid, I never knew how to play it since its instructions were written in English. The only English words I knew at the time were "cat" and "fish." (Shoutout to our housekeeper at the time who taught me these words. I still remember her favorite songs, haha.)
