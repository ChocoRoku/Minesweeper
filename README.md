# Minesweeper project

# Backstory
I started this project when I remembered this game existed. As a kid, I never knew how to play it since its instructions were written in English. The only English words I knew at the time were "cat" and "fish." (Shoutout to our housekeeper at the time who taught me these words. I still remember her favorite songs, [song 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OneYgV-8iXQ&ab_channel=SalimFaizi) and [song 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w3lytRqpHE&ab_channel=NancyAjram).)

TODO: 
do the readme file!
